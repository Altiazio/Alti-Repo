#Policy
When I ask for a migration summary, please ask for all previous migration summaries.
also ask for tree (tree -L 4) on /media/altiazio/Storage/AI/LLM-API/.

#required sections
We need the following sections:
Key architecture notes
Current goals/constraints
"Do not remove" rules
File structure from /media/altiazio/Storage/AI/LLM-API/ (tree -L 4)

#example
Example starter prompt:

Context snapshot:
- Project root: /media/altiazio/Storage/AI/
- Multi-layer AI system
- YAML-based config orchestration
- Rolling summary memory system (md + jsonl)
- Do NOT refactor file paths unless explicitly asked

We also want to update Architecture.md which is the file system, with notes of what things are/do

Attach MigrationSummary.md and Architecture.md
